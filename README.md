# bostonvulnerability

Exposure to lead, especially at a young age, can have severe physical and cognitive effects such as damage to the kidney and brain, anemia, and behavioral changes. Further, because exposure to lead is often a result of a place’s built environment, low-income communities and communities of color are at the highest risk of lead exposure and severe illness due to lead, because of historical disinvestment in their built environment. Based on the State of Massachusetts’ Child hood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program’s 2020 Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report, about 1,880 children living in the state had blood levels over the CDC action level of ? 5 µg/dL. Further, the report identified 17 high-risk communities, several of which are located within the Boston Metropolitan area. Communities identified in this category have at least 15 kids every year for the past 5 years who have blood-lead levels higher than 10 µg/dL (this is considered evident of lead poisoning). These communities were: 

* Boston 
* Brockton 
* Chelsea 
* Chicopee 
* Everett 
* Fall River 
* Fitchburg 
* Holyoke 
* Lawrence 
* Lowell 
* Lynn 
* Malden 
* New Bedford 
* Pittsfield 
* Springfield 
* Westfield 
* Worcester

According to the report, more than half of children with high-blood-lead levels live in these communities. Using criteria established by the US Center for Disease Control which identifies populations most at risk of being exposed to lead, as well as blood-lead levels from the Massachusetts Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention program, this vulnerability analysis will identify zip codes in the Boston Metropolitan Region at the highest risk of lead exposure. The criteria included in this analysis are as follows: 

* Percent of Children under the age of 6
	o Kids under the age of 6 are considered the most at-risk of lead exposure, as they are the most likely to orally come into contact with lead-	containing items, such as paint, soil, consumer products, and cosmetics. 
* Percent of workers employed in a construction, natural resource, or maintenance occupation
	o Due to the nature of their work, people working in these occupations are at a higher risk of coming into contact with lead than those not working 	in these occupations. Further, they are more likely to bring enough lead remnants home to have adverse health effects on their children. 
* Percent of houses built before 1980
	o Houses constructed before the 1978 lead-paint ban are most likely to have been painted with lead-based paint, putting individuals living in these 	houses at a higher risk of being exposed to lead. Likewise, these houses are more likely to contain lead-based plumbing fixtures. 
* Low-income households
	o Since houses located in low-income areas tend to be older, low-income households are the more likely to live in houses containing lead. 
* Percent of children screened with blood-lead levels above 5 µg/dL. 
	
Results from this analysis indicated that vulnerability is visually clustered in communities north and south of the City of Boston. Communities 	towards the west, tend to have lower vulnerability, with the lowest vulnerability score being a zip code in Danvers, MA. However, some communities 	in this area, including Milford, Marlborough, and Framingham indicate higher levels of vulnerability compared to the surrounding communities. 

###Instructions for Running the Notebook:

1. Open Jupyter lab
2. Upload notebook, all csv. Files, and all files in both the Massachusetts_zipcodes folder, and mpo_boundaries folder to Jupyter lab. 
3. Restart and run the kernel. 

###Description of Data Files and Preprocessing Steps by Criteria

* Percent of Children under the age of 5
	o File name: ageandsex.csv
	o Source: Final Project Data Folder, 2019 ACS 5-year Estimates
		* Table: Age and Sex (ACSST5Y2019.S0101)
		* Column used in dataset: S0101_C02_002E; Estimate Percent Total Population Age Under 5 years
	o Preprocessing Steps: All preprocessing for this data took place in the project notebook. 
* Percent of workers employed in a construction, natural resource, or maintenance occupation
	o File name: occupation1.csv
	o Source: Policy Map, 2019 ACS 5-year Estimates
		* Table: Occupation by Sex for the Civilian Employed Population 16 Years and Over (S2401)
	o Preprocessing steps: Data did not need preprocessing once exported as a .csv. 
* Percent of houses built before 1980
	o File name: housingage.csv
	o Source: Policy Map, 2019 ACS 5-year Estimates
		* Table: Selected Housing Characteristics (DP04)
	o Preprocessing steps: Data did not need preprocessing. 
* Low-income households
	o File name: income.csv
	o Source: Policy Map, 2019 ACS 5-year Estimates
		* Table: Income in the Past 12 Months (S1903)
	o Preprocessing Steps: Data did not need preprocessing
* Percent of children screened with blood-lead levels above 5 µg/dL. 
	o Source: Massachusetts Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program
		* 2018 Annual Childhood Lead Poisoning Surveillance Report
		* Column used: Percent of children tested who’s lead level was below 5 µg/dL.
			* Due to hippa, the report could not indicate specific percentages of children screened who did test above the CDC action level(although this could be calculated based on percentages who did not), which is why this column was used, as it had more data. Communities where a higher percentage of children tested with normal levels were identified as being less vulnerable. 
		* Preprocessing: The data were originally in a non-python-friendly format. I extracted the town name and percentage column I needed into a separate CSV. Then, I used a separate 		spreadsheet with a list of town names and their zip codes to match the town-level percentages to each zipcode (basically a 1-to-many join).
